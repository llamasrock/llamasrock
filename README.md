Currently I am a Master of Applied Cybernetics student at Australian National University's School of Cybernetics. 

I am new to GitHub and would like to learn how to use to collaborate on coding projects with my classmates. 

My objectives for the second and final semester of my degree:
- Integrate GitHub into my coding environment
- Learn best practices for collaborative coding
